Open repository for developing an easy and affordable solution for recording spots games.

The main idea is to create a service which will utilize two cameras connected to SBC device such as Raspberry pi or Jetson Nano.
The project will depict the use of ball tracking algorithm and perform digital zoom with a set frame around the ball to capture current motion on field.

Videos will be stored in internal device at first phase and later a functionality will be added for live streaming and saving the video onto cloud storage.
